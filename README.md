# Environmental-Justice-SFS-POV
This is a project comparing poverty census data and cross referencing it with EPA data on where Superfund Sites (more commonly known as hazardous waste sites).
My hypothesis: In this first stage of the project I am only focusing on the State of New Jersey. I chose New Jersey beause they have the greatest number of hazardous waste sites out of all 50 US states (115 SFS!) Many environmental researchers have already shown that Superfund Sites are predominately located in areas with large quantities of people of color. I wanted to see if that was also true for low income communities. 
I hope in make this projet would be scalable in the future so that I can incorporate all 50 states data, but rn I just want it to work lol
